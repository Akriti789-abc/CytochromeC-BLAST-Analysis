# CytochromeC-BLAST-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the comparative analysis of the cytochrome c protein across
different species using the BLASTP tool provided by NCBI. Cytochrome c is a key
mitochondrial protein involved in the electron transport chain and is known to be
highly conserved during evolution.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To identify homologous cytochrome c protein sequences in different organisms
- To analyze sequence similarity using BLASTP
- To study evolutionary relationships using a phylogenetic tree

---

## 🧪 Tools and Databases Used
- NCBI BLASTP
- NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database
- BLAST Tree View (Fast Minimum Evolution method)

---

## 🧬 Sequences Used
The cytochrome c protein sequence from *Homo sapiens* was used as the query.
Homologous sequences from the following species were included for comparison:
- Pan troglodytes (Chimpanzee)
- Papio anubis (Baboon)
- Symphalangus syndactylus (Siamang)
- Mus musculus (Mouse)
- Bos taurus (Cow)
- Gallus gallus (Chicken)
- Danio rerio (Zebrafish)

---

## 🔬 Methodology
1. The cytochrome c protein sequence of *Homo sapiens* was retrieved from the NCBI
   protein database in FASTA format.
2. BLASTP was performed against the non-redundant (nr) protein database.
3. Top significant hits were selected based on:
   - High percentage identity
   - 100% query coverage
   - Very low E-value
4. A phylogenetic tree was generated using the BLAST Tree View tool based on
   pairwise sequence alignments.

## 📊 Results

### 1. BLAST Alignment Results
BLASTP analysis showed that cytochrome c is highly conserved across species.
Primate species such as *Pan troglodytes*, *Papio anubis*, and *Symphalangus syndactylus*
displayed extremely high sequence similarity with *Homo sapiens*.

- Query coverage: 100%
- Percentage identity: 98–100%
- E-value range: 3e-70 to 1e-69

These results indicate strong evolutionary conservation of the cytochrome c protein.

### 2. Phylogenetic Tree Analysis
A phylogenetic tree was generated using the Fast Minimum Evolution method with the
Grishin (protein) distance model. The tree illustrates evolutionary relationships
based on cytochrome c protein sequence similarity.

Primates were grouped together in a single cluster, showing close evolutionary
relationships with humans. Non-primate species were placed on more distant branches,
indicating greater evolutionary divergence.

---

## 🧠 Interpretation
The close clustering of primate species in both BLAST alignment results and the
phylogenetic tree confirms that cytochrome c is a highly conserved protein among
closely related organisms. The conservation reflects the essential role of cytochrome c
in cellular respiration and mitochondrial function.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This study demonstrates that BLASTP is an effective tool for identifying homologous
protein sequences and studying evolutionary relationships. The conserved nature of
cytochrome c across species highlights its critical biological function and supports
the evolutionary closeness of primates to humans.
